            <strong>Lyrics</strong>
            
            You call me out upon the waters
            The great unknown where feet may fail
            And there I find You in the mystery
            In oceans deep my faith will stand

            And I will call upon Your Name
            And keep my eyes above the waves
            When oceans rise
            My soul will rest in Your embrace
            For I am Yours and You are mine

            Your grace abounds in deepest waters
            Your sovereign hand will be my guide
            Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
            You've never failed and You won't start now

            So I will call upon Your Name
            And keep my eyes above the waves
            When oceans rise
            My soul will rest in Your embrace
            For I am Yours and You are mine, oh

            And You are mine, oh

            Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
            Let me walk upon the waters
            Wherever You would call me
            Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
            And my faith will be made stronger
            In the presence of my Saviour

            Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
            Let me walk upon the waters
            Wherever You would call me
            Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
            And my faith will be made stronger
            In the presence of my Saviour

            Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
            Let me walk upon the waters
            Wherever You would call me
            Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
            And my faith will be made stronger
            In the presence of my Saviour

            Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
            Let me walk upon the waters
            Wherever You would call me
            Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
            And my faith will be made stronger
            In the presence of my Saviour

            Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
            Let me walk upon the waters
            Wherever You would call me
            Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
            And my faith will be made stronger
            In the presence of my Saviour

            Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
            Let me walk upon the waters
            Wherever You would call me
            Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
            And my faith will be made stronger
            In the presence of my Saviour
            
            I will call upon Your Name
            Keep my eyes above the waves
            My soul will rest in Your embrace
            I am Yours and You are mine
